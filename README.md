# Project 1
<img src="images/hi.png"><br>
A project to introduce myself and showcase my work! I plan to be building websites, managing clients' social media channels - that sorta fun stuff - and using this site as my portfolio.

**UX**<br>
This site is responsive on both desktop and mobile. I've kept it clean and clutter-free, so far at least, for ease of viewing and use.<br><br>
**Technologies Used**<br>
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub
- I will probably use PHP for bringing the contact form to life
<br><br>

**Testing**<br>
Please do, and let me know of any bugs or other annoying things! There isn't much aside from the nav bar currently, but once the contact form is functional I'd love for that to be tested, as well as hyperlinks I'll put on the goods page, to sites I've built. Also do let me know how you find the responsiveness.<br><br>
**Deployment**<br>
I created this website using Visual Studio Code and a local git directory, and from there I uploaded the project to GitHub. I have made it live using Git pages. I deployed the project to GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow is set to trigger when there is a push to the default branch of my repository, and automatically publish the changes to my project.<br><br>
